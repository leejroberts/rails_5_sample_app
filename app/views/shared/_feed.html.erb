<% if @feed_items.any? %> 
  <ol class="microposts">
    <%= render @feed_items %><!--important note!-->
  </ol>
    <%= will_paginate @feed_items %>
<% end %>
<!--
checks for existing user microposts (.any?) 
  if true
    renders the microposts into the partial as an ordered list
    !!! it renders each micropost using the _micropost partial !!!
      rails 'knows' to do this bc @feed_items...
        each have a RUBY class of Micropost.
        thus, rails looks for a partial and/or folder with the same name finding...
        views/microposts/_micropost.html.erb
    finally the results are paginated using the pagination gem
