<!-- the following code is in JQuery -->
$("#follow_form").html("<%= escape_javascript(render('users/unfollow')) %>");
$("#followers").html('<%= @user.followers.count %>');

<!-- line 2 identifies an html divider with the class follow_form
it then renders the unfollow form 
this change is strictly visual, the actual following/relationship join is handled in the relationship controller
escape_javascript is a jquery method needed for the render action to work  

line 3 identifies the html divider with the class followers, 
  then recounts the number of followers and repopulates the stats
  so that the numbers update every time the user clicks follow or unfollow buttons
